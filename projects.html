												<h3>Doublin</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Doublin is a couch coop arena typing game made as a proof of concept in only a few weeks.</p>
											<p>In Doublin, you play as two gobblins in a wizard robe. In order to prevent their cave from being reposessed by the goblin IRS, they enter a wizard tournament disguised as the wizard they killed. There's just one problem: they don't know how to fight like a wizard. Luckily, they also grabbed the wizard's grimoire.</p>
											<p>Player one must control the movement and spellcasting, while player two must navigate the grimoire. Player one must relay the hat shape, color, and staff ornament of the other wizards to player two, who will decode this information and decide on the correct spell to relay back to player one. This game is all about communication, so act quickly and try not to get too tongue-twisted!</p>
